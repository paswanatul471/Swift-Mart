# Swift-Mart

Swift-Mart is my Flipkart-inspired web project. I built it using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Material UI. It has a great design and features like adding products to a cart, wishlists, and secure buying. The website looks good on computers and phones. It shows I can create websites, design well, and make complex things work.
